Chefmoji is a synchronized multiplayer web-based game where pairs of players collaborate to serve plated meals. After logging in, users can either create a new game or join an existing one. In games, players navigate a 2D map comprised entirely of emoji, follow recipes to cook various emoji dishes, and rack up points with each successfully completed meal. 

Chefmoji is an application developed by Team Sixth Sense. Visit [chefmoji.wtf](https://chefmoji.wtf) in Google Chrome on your laptop or desktop computer to start playing!

### Platform

Ensure you are upgraded to macOS Catalina to have the most updated emoji support.

### To Build

You will need to clone this repository then run some commands in the Makefile. Using a command window, navigate to an empty directory on your computer and run the following commands. Note that you will need 2 .env files and a .pem file to build the project, which can be obtained from the original developers. (However, these files are ***TOP SECRET*** and we probably won't give them to you. Sorry.)

```
git clone https://github.com/cs188-software-design-security-w20/project-sixth-sense.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
make install
make build-base
make prod
```
